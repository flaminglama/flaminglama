    <h2>General Info</h2>
     <ul class="cat-list">
    <li>Avoid touching Sandý after you have applied any lotion or cream on your hands or touched foods like garlic, onion and chilies. It is better to wash your hands before touching her if you have touched any chemicals or food that you don’t know are safe for cats.</li>
    <li>If you want to open windows, you have to either keep your eyes on the window that is open all the time, close the door to the room with an open window or put Sandý in a room where the window is closed and keep the door to that room closed until you have closed the open window.</li>
    <li>Sandý likes to try to eat our food and drink our water, so keep an eye on your food and drink (especially water) if you leave it out or put it somewhere where Sandý cannot reach it.
      <ul>
        <li>Rinse your plates and bowls or put them straight into the dishwasher right after eating so Sandý can’t lick them.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>On rare, truly rare occasions Sandý might throw up or get poop on the floor. Do not worry, just use toilet paper or small white towels to clean it up. 
      <ul>
        <li>You can also use some cleaning product on the spot that got dirty.</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Sandý is healthy and you shouldn’t have any problems with her. She might sneeze sometimes or scratch herself but nothing like that is a cause for worrying. 
        <ul>
          <li>However, if something serious does happen or you can visibly tell that something is wrong (you see blood in urine/poop, she has a bleeding wound, she doesn’t eat and/or drink for more than a day), then you can contact this animal clinic: <a href="https://dagfinnur.is">dagfinnur.is</a>.

    <h2>Food &amp; Water</h2>
    <p>In general, we give Sandý food and replace her water twice a day, in the morning and evening, which means that the gap between feedings is around 12 hours. It is totally fine if it is not exactly 12 hours – we do not follow a super strict schedule.</p>
    <p>Sandý has two types of food: dry food in the big bag and wet food in individual bags. We either give her just dry food or both types of food during the day.</p>
    <h3>Dry Food</h3>
     <ul class="cat-list">
    <li>Around 27 g, morning and evening.</li>
    <li>Use the bowl with a cat face on it.</li>
    <li>Wash the bowl before filling it with food.
      <ul>
        <li>You can wash it with just water but if you use dish soap, rinse it really well.</li>
        <li>You can use any kitchen towel to dry it.</li>
      </ul>
       </ul>
    <h3>Wet &amp; Dry Food</h3>
    <ul class="cat-list">
      <li>You can give Sandý one bag of wet food in the morning instead of dry food if you want to.
        <ul>
          <li>Try not to leave the wet food out for the entire day – if she doesn’t finish everything in a couple of hours then you need to throw out the rest in the organic waste bin.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>Use the black bowl for wet food</li>
        <li>If you give Sandý wet food in the morning, then you need to give her a bit more dry food later than normally – around <b>39-40 g</b></li>
        <li>You can then give her the bowl with dry food earlier than normally because it’s a bigger portion</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Weighing the Food</h3>
    <ul class="cat-list">
      <li>We use the small kitchen scale to weigh the dry food.
        <ul>
          <li>Put the bowl on the scale before you turn it on.</li>
         <li>Make sure the units on the scale are grams or kilograms.</li>
          <li>Sometimes the scale doesn’t work properly, then you can try turning it off and on again.</li>
         <li>The scale isn’t always super accurate either but as long as the amount of food looks about right, it’s okay.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
  <h3>Water</h3>
    <ul class="cat-list">
      <li>Use cold water from the tap.</li>
      <li>Replace it in the morning and evening and whenever you notice that the water might be dirty.</li>
      <li>Rinse the bowl before filling it with fresh water.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Emptying the Litter Box</h2>
     <ul class="cat-list">
    <li>Do it once a day.
      <ul>
        <li>You can do it more often if you feel like it.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Take one bag from the black roll of small plastic bags.</li>
    <li>Remove the top of the litter box by opening the clasps on the sides.</li>
    <li>Use the shovel on the side to scoop out the poop and clumps of pee.
      <ul>
        <li>I recommend scooping from under, i.e. stick the shovel down to the bottom of the box before pushing it forward.</li>
        <li>Try to avoid sticking the shovel straight into a clump of pee – it will crumble and make it harder to shovel it all out.</li>
      </ul>
    <li>Tie a knot on the bag and either put it outside and leave it at the front door until the next time you leave the apartment or take it straight to the general waste bin that is outside.</li>
    <li>Wash your hands.</li>

    <h2>Grooming</h2>
    <ul class="cat-list">
      <li>In general, she takes good care of her herself.</li>
      <li>You can brush her with the cat brush to remove loose hair (and give her a massage).</li>
      <li>She might sometimes get some cat litter, and on very, very rare occasions some poop, stuck to the fur around her butt.
        <ul>
          <li>I usually just use some wet toilet paper to wipe off the cat litter or dry toilet paper to remove the poop and then flush it down the toilet.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Fun &amp; Play</h2>
    <h3>Play Time</h3>
     <ul class="cat-list">
    <li>Try to play with her at least 15 minutes every day.</li>
    <li>She likes to chase little mice and balls, so you can throw them to her/across the room when you want to play with her.</li>
    <li>There are some toys in the right drawer under the TV that you can use.</li>
       </ul>
    <h3>Taking Her on Walks</h3>
    <ul class="cat-list">
      <li>Sandý likes to go outside but you are not required to take her.</li>
      <li>If you do want to go outside with her, put the pink leash on her.
        <ul>
          <li>The shorter strings go around her neck.</li>
          <li>The longer strings go around her body (stomach/chest area).</li>
          <li>Make sure the clasps are closed.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Don't let go of the leash when outside with her.</li>
      <li>Don't pull the leash/her.
        <ul>
          <li>If you need to go somewhere and she is not moving, pick her up.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>She likes to climb fences sometimes and go through bushes but don't let her go anywhere where it might be difficult to get her out again from.</li>
      <li>When she is scared or sees another cat, she might start running very suddenly and fast. Don't let go of the leash.</li>
    </ul>
